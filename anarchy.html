      <p>Make it stop!! Now! Modern democracy is a farce. Swelling armies of beaurocrats stamp,
      sign, and sort mountains of meaningless documents. Dutiful little civil servants. Meanwhile
      the great unwashed continue bumbbling about the mall believe they are free and doing gods work
      by howing up early for the big sale at Manceys. THey are not even remotely free and they
      need a fucking shower.</p> 
      <p>Teamwork is humanities superpower. The ability to work together made us bigger, faster, stronger. 
      Weak hairless apes become top of the food chain, transcending the animal kingdom altogether giving 
      us dominion over nature and the ability to break free of the glacial pace of natural evolution and 
      drive our own metamorphosis. </p>
      <p>We need to be social. We ARE social by nature it is our defining feature and that which makes s.com/css?family=Macondo" />

      us more than animal. But where did this hierarchy bullshit come from. That is not natural at all. 
      Somewhere along the way some well spoken but weak minded people decided that we needed order damnit. That 
      someone needed to be in charge. And it stuck. Ever since small groups of fat balding white men have hid in 
      centralized black boxes and controlled massive government, corporate, and financial machines that do more 
      to enslave the masses then generate wealth for their masters. If wealth was all they were after they could 
      open things up, get more money flowing throughout the economy, benefit from an a bottomless well of free 
      opensource style labor and everybody would be richer. but wealth is not what theyre after. Power is. 
      Keeping the weak under their thumb.</p>
      <p>We don't need government. We never have. And now we really don't. We have all of the tools we need 
      to self organize and fix our own pot holes. We can bind together geographically or globally around a 
      common cause or interest. People with the problems fixing them themselves. Who'da'thunk? Instead of government 
      granted development projects that either stall for years, die and never finish, or simply cost alot of money 
      and not only not fix the original problem but create a much bigger one. We can fix our own potholes. Quicker, 
      cheaper, and the way we want them fixed. Yes it would cost money but would you rather pay to fix a problem 
      that directly affects you or just one giant lump sum taken from you without your permission ostensibly to 
      fix everybody's problems but mostly just get's used invading other countries and threatening and intimidating 
      the entire world into liking us or elses.</p>
      <p>Fucking war, fuck bullying, fuck beign a superpower, fuck taxes, fuck governments, corporations, and banks. Fuck hierarchy and fuck 
      taking life so god damn seriously. The end of centralized power is nigh and there is nothing anyone could or should do about it. 
      Localization, distributed/encrypted/massively redundant systems that store all of our data, eliminate fraud, and give us the power to protect
       our assets, transact, and contract without overly paid highly corrupt and fallible human "experts". An economy of abundance in which 
       everything every needs is just available locally and anything extravagant or complicated can be provided by volunteers or acquired by 
       bartering. No corporations needed. No banks needed. No government needed. Only friendliness and cooperation needed. Welcome to Sociable Anarchy. BE FREE!!!!z  </p>
