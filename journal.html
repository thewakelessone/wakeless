  		<h3>AI:Text to Image generation is nothing new.</h3>
  		<p>I mean it is, but... I don't know can't think of a better title right now. I'll ask ChatGPT later but here's 
  		my point now.</p>
  		<p>I got my first job as a web designer in 1999. My actual title was Multimedia Director. Funny. I 
  		learned to program the hard way and against my will because if I wanted some ground breaking feature like 
  		mouseovers I had to figure it out myself. I remember building a cdrom for flagstaff arizona's visitor 
  		bureau. Mac OSX had just come out so I had a windows pc, an OSX box, and an OS9 box. I spent hours chasing 
  		fonts and layout details around in a circle trying to get them to look right on all 3.</p>
  		<p>Now using something like react/nextjs or any number of modern web development frameworks I can get a working 
  		site skeleton that looks decent running in 5 minutes and never have to worry about the gorie details. Is
  		anyone complaining about frameworks stealing developers jobs or putting designers out of work? No. The level 
  		of quality is just way easier to achieve. You can still spend hours pushing pixels around if you really 
  		want to and individual style is still what is valued most. It's easy to get a good looking stock website 
  		up and running now but nobody wants to look at it and certainly no one wants to pay for it. A designers 
  		talent is just as valuable if not more so than it's ever been.
  		</p>
  		<p>AI text to image generation is this same phenomenon applicable to the wider realm of all visual artists. 
  		Being able to generate a handful of studies to test a simple idea like "transformers except instead of cars 
  		they are disguised as birthday cakes" in a matter of minutes is just awesome. And the potential for creative 
  		discover via happy accidents, which has always been a powerful and fundamental technique, is now endless. No 
  		one wanted to see a cowboy on the moon before and they really don't now. But an artists unique style will never 
  		go out of style.  </p>
