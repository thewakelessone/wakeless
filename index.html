          <span class="title">Civilization is Rubble.</span>
          <p>Capitalism is dying and the era of giant centralized power and wealth hoarding corporations,
            banks, financial institutions, social and religious organizations, and nation states is
            almost, mercifully, over. The fat rich balding white dudes that have been hoarding the wealth
            of the world and limiting the flow and access of information since the dawn of civilization will
            not go down without a fight however so there are some ugly years to come. But the war is already won
            as there is no power on heaven or earth that is a match for the collective intelligence and will
            of the human race. So order that case of Dom and polish your oyster tray but don't send out the
            invitations just yet. There is still work to be done. </p>
          <p><i>If you are as excited and impatient as we are join the cause and foment insurrection. Help us
            hasten the pace of the revolution or if you know of a better way call us and we'll join you.</i></p>
          <p>Wakeless is a conceptional framework designed to prepare us for the impending transformation.
            A set of ideologies, methodologies, architectural schemes, philosophical, social, cultural and
            political perspectives based on our best educated guess of what the world will soon be like. These
            ideas are constantly evolving and the more raw data, intelligent analysis, and unique perspective we
            can build into the feedback loop the better these predictions will become. They are designed primarily
            as a sort of template for creating or restructuring pretty much any type of organization. If
            implemented well the resulting concoction should be well suited for the new paradigm. We hope. One
            thing we know for certain is that an entirely new approach is needed starting with a new definition
            of success.

        <span class="title">Painting a picture of the past</span>
        <p><i>Art is just decoration. Nothing more.</i> Well cave paintings were art and the
		        first steps toward the development of written language. <i>So I guess art gave us civilization but it's
            not important like science.</i> Except the first scientists spent most of their time drawing and no one
            without great skill at drawing could be a scientist at all until the 19th century. But no artist has
            contributed anything useful... well there were the innumerable inventions of davinci and JS Bach did invent
            the 12 tone musical system which made all western music for the last 500 years possible. But it's not like
            they had anything to do with the 7 wonders of the.... oh wait.
        </p>
        <p>The truth is "Artist" is a fundamental archetype meaning anyone that uses technology of some sort in a creative
          manner that results in something of exceptional aesthetic value. They play a number of vital roles in society,
          they ARE culture, and responsible for the invention of civilization in the first place. They have been called
          many things such as medicine man and hacker and they pull alot of strings behind the scenes to keep things,
          well, bearable.

          <span class="title">A history of the west: part 1</span>
          <p>Our history can be understood as one long war between those that embrace openness and sharing of ideas - the
            natural mode of human action that has led to our every success - and those that horde, limit the flow of information
            and jealously guard new discoveries and inventions as if they own them. Notably the Greeks had an open society
            and the result was an explosion of progress placing them centuries ahead of their time. Then the library of
            alexandria was burned and all was lost. The jews, christians, and muslims then took control and 2,000 years
            of stagnation dominated until the renaissance when the open team fought back with advent of science.</p>
          <p>The last 500 years has been a bloody stalemate more or less and then in the 1970's and 80's a fatal blow
            was struck by the good guys. The gnu public license, the birth of the opensource movement and it's champion
            linux. The invention of the internet and it's donation to the world at large also played a vital role.
            The war isn't quite over yet but it has been won. Decisively.</p>

          <span class="title">the wakeless agenda</span>
          <p>Leverage the power of the group to make interesting, useful, and aesthetically
          pleasing things, promote the artists and engineers of the collective and
          their work, aid the cause of freedom and sociable anarchism, and foment
          the revolution. This is our fundamental agenda. </p>
        <p>We value transparency and collaboration as the best means to achieve
          success in all things. We despise patents, copyrights, and intellectual property.
          We mock the notion of thought ownership and wonder where your supposed to
          the little orange flags.</p>
        <p>We recognize that frenetic innovation rates have triggered a revolution so
          many orders of magnitude beyond any that have come before that it is essentially
          beyond our ability to predict or comprehend any possible outcome. We do know,
          however, that a total transformation is guaranteed. A total transformation of
          culture, society, civilization, infrasctructure, the environment and the species
          itself.</p>
        <p>We have 2 major goals in this regard. 1 is to watch closely, analyze, and make
          predictions then use that knowledge to create organizations built to thrive
          in the new reality. 2nd is to participate in the revolution itself if even in
          some small way just to be a part of this profound historic event.</p>
