          <span class="title">Civilization is Rubble.</span>
          <p>Capitalism is dying and the era of giant centralized power and wealth hoarding corporations,
            banks, financial institutions, social and religious organizations, and nation states is
            almost, mercifully, over. The fat rich balding white dudes that have been hoarding the wealth
            of the world and limiting the flow and access of information since the dawn of civilization will
            not got down without a fight so there are some ugly years to come. The war is already won though
            as there is no power on heaven or earth that is a match for the collective intelligence and will
            of the human race. </p>
          <p>Wakeless is a conceptional framework. A set of ideologies, methodologies,
            architectural schemes, philosophical, social, cultural and political perspectives. If
            implemented well the resulting organization should be well suited for the new paradigm.
            An entirely new approach is needed including redefining success.

            <li>A Brand: A guarantee of aesthetic excellence and technical mastery</li>
            <li>A producer, collector, supporter, and curator of Art. When mass production becomes
              trivial a culture of one-of-a-kindness will elevate artists and craftsman.   </li>

              of objects, things, products, entities, worlds, contraptions, and the like.</li>
