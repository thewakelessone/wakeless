          <p>Art is just decoration. Nothing more. Well cave paintings were art and the
		        first steps toward the development of written language. So I guess art gave us civilization but it's
            not important like science. Except the first scientists spent most of their time drawing and no one
            without great skill at drawing could be a scientist at all until the 19th century. But no artist has
            contributed anything useful... well there were the innumerable inventions of davinci and JS Bach did invent
            the 12 tone musical system which made all western music for the last 500 years possible. But it's not like
            they had anything to do with the 7 wonders of the.... oh wait.
	        </p>
          <span class="title">A history of the west: part 1</span>
          <p>Our history can be understood as one long war between those that embrace openness and sharing of ideas - the
            natural mode of human action that has led to our every success - and those that horde, limit the flow of information
            and jealously guard new discoveries and inventions as if they own them. Notably the Greeks had an open society
            and the result was an explosion of progress placing them centuries ahead of their time. Then the library of
            alexandria was burned and all was lost. The jews, christians, and muslims then took control and 2,000 years
            of stagnation dominated until the renaissance when the open team fought back with advent of science.</p>
          <p>The last 500 years has been a bloody stalemate more or less and then in the 1970's and 80's a fatal blow
            was struck by the good guys. The gnu public license, the birth of the opensource movement and it's champion
            linux, and the invention of the internet and it's donation to the world at large. The war isn't quite
            over yet but it has been won. Decisively.</p>
