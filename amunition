1500/month cost  --- 1800/month retail
13,500/ 9 months cost 16,000 retail

over winter months very little mechanical work was done
never even had hot water, couldn't finish floor, had to
buy another generator for $200
lost several hundred paying for things that never
showed up gas, propane, furniture, gas money loans, etc..,


estimate 4 months X 1500 = $6000 no major work done just
errands and minor tweaks

an afternoon of driving costs 20-30 so 3/per week for 4 months is 1400ish
leaving about $5000

Im sure i could have done any work done at an expensive mechanic for under $1000
so even giving another $1000 for registration and just generosity
that's still $3000 and that's just the bags I sent home
not the shit you smoked while there or any of the clear.



last week

stolen trailer results in a day in jail and loss of $800
had to pawn skooter to survive which cost me $75

trailer burns down (mechanical issue) cost me $8-10,000 at least
had to pawn skooter to survice which cost me $100


you have cost me at least $20,000 over the last year and couldn't trust me with a
skooter that by rights I have already paid for many times over but it's ok for me
to have to wait 4 days and trust that you'll pay me 400 measley dollars after I just
literally lost everything I own. Because I didn't answer the phone 1 time for very good
reason and you had to feed your own habit one day out of the last year.
