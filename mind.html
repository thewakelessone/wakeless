        <p>So shit just got real. Well Artificial really. No really, Artificial Intelligence just got smart
        AND Artificial Intelligence just got creative. As of now, early 2023, a littany of
        machine learning systems are available that will, given simple instructions, create
        stunning images and write prose, poetry, scientific and technical documents, and even
        tell jokes. It is possible for pretty much anyone to create professional'ish
        creative content and alot of graphic designers and copywriters have found themselves
        out of work. It has become easy for people with no skill to experience the thrill of
        creative expression. </p>
        <p>It has also given those of with a true passion for art a fucking
        literal magic wand. We can work through ideas in minutes and hours that would take weeks and
        months and we can do so many things that were flatout impossible. It's quite simply
        intoxicating. So I think the loss of a few thousand short sighted hacks is worth the
        price of admission. </p>
        <p>So this is the beginning of a conversation and a collaboration between man and machine.
        A partnership between the human beings known as the Wakeless Collective and a few artificially
        intelligent creative entities. We will be continually adding images, clips, texts, journal entries
        and the software we discover and create for any and all to follow along, utilize in their own
        experiments, or join us for what should be a really wild ride.</p>
